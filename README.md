# ShaderVisualisationTool

# Goal 
* The goal of this project is to create a simple application that allows the user to view the effects of a written shader on different objects such as Squares, Triangles, Cubes and more. 
* This application will allow the user to choose what object is rendered, to load in shaders of different types (Vertex, Fragment, Compute) and then to render the object with the loaded shaders
* The hope is to also add support for writing shaders within the application with a simple text editor which will mean the user can write and test shaders without leaving the application.

# Libraries 
* Dear ImGui 
* GLFW
* OpenGL
* PFD (Portable-File-Dialogs)
* GLAD

# Features
* Ability to select from different Primitives (Triangle, Square)
* Ability to indefinetely load different Vertex and Fragment shaders (other shader support such as Compute shaders planned)
* Console readout for errors and messages 
* Planned Shader Editor (For editing shader files while in the application)
